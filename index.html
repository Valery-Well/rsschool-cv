<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am 29 years old.. For several years I worked in various fields: sales representative, municipal employee, gas worker and in a public organization.. In all these works, part of the interaction with programs was involved. So I got carried away with the IT sphere. Testing, web design... But as a result, I was interested in frontend.</p>
<p>While working in the municipal service, I moderated the section of the municipal institution on the official portal of the city authorities (posting news, resolutions, notifications about activities).</p>
<p>I was an information systems specialist in a public organization. I worked with databases and several services of the organization to work with voters for the election period.</p>
